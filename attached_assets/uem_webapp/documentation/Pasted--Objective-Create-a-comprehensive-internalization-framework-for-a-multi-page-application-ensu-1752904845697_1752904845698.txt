**Objective:** Create a comprehensive internalization framework for a multi-page application, ensuring that no display text or logging messages are hardcoded at the code level.

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify Pages:**
   - List all pages within the application, including but not limited to home, about, contact, user profile, settings, and any other relevant pages.

2. **Text Extraction:**
   - For each identified page, extract all user-facing text, including headings, labels, buttons, tooltips, and any logging or error messages.

3. **Localization Strategy:**
   - Define a localization strategy that includes:
     - Supported languages.
     - Formatting for date, time, numbers, and currencies.
     - Fallback mechanisms for missing translations.

4. **Text Storage:**
   - Propose a method for storing extracted text, such as JSON or XML files, ensuring that each piece of text is keyed appropriately for easy retrieval.

5. **Dynamic Text Rendering:**
   - Implement a system for dynamically rendering text from the storage method, ensuring there are no direct strings in the code.
   - Include an example of how to retrieve and display a localized string in a typical component.

6. **Logging Implementation:**
   - Revisit logging within the application. Ensure that all log messages are also sourced from the localization files.
   - Provide examples for different log levels (info, warning, error) showing how to implement this with externalized strings.

7. **Review and Quality Assurance:**
   - Create a checklist for reviewing each page to ensure:
     - All text has been externalized.
     - Correct keys are used for localization.
     - Language switching is functional and tested.
     - Logging messages are externalized and appropriate for their context.
  
8. **Documentation:**
   - Produce comprehensive documentation outlining:
     - The internalization framework setup.
     - Guidelines for adding new text or languages in the future.
     - Steps for testing and validating the internalization process.

**Output Requirements:**
- A complete list of all pages with their corresponding externalized texts.
- A clear structure for the localization files.
