I want to create an enterprise endpoint management architecture( provide an mermaid script for this, to create do not use following special character. dot, double quote, single quote,  open and close parenthesis.). In end point architecture, following are the must components. 1. Multi-tenant  and multi Domain application UI which supports various customers in single UI instance. 2. Thin client should connect to respective satellite server for an customer there can be multiple satellite servers and client should connect to their respective satellite server only.  3. Satellite server can be installed based on the network traffic or regional basis the client should connect to their respective satellite server. 4. satellite server should connect to centralized data collector component which is on high availability.   the centralized data collector will internally connect with database. 5. introduce api gate servers to handle multiple customer request and redirect to respective to microservice application, also introduce message bus, Orchestration, Identity provider,  etc... 





You are a skilled software developer with extensive experience in designing user interfaces and creating intuitive user experiences. Your specialty lies in developing complex application menus that are both functional and user-friendly.

Your task is to create an Agent-based Discovery Main Menu with the following features:  
1. The policies which are created should be deployable/publishable to agent-based discovery.  
2. While deploying the policy, the following files and features are essential:  
   a. Discovery policy inventory schedule name, description.  
   b. Targets, to define the IP range, hostname list, OU path, IP segments, etc.  
   c. Select the credential profile.  
   d. Provide a probe selection option, allowing for single, multiple, or all options.  
   e. Schedule: it should have an option to run now or later, where the later option should be frequency-based (e.g., during business hours or after business hours).  
   f. Review the options and submit.  
3. On the same screen, a policy deployment list should be present to view the list of machines applied, in progress, pending, etc., along with any errors listed.

The output should be structured in a clear, organized manner, resembling a software interface design specification. Include sections for each of the features mentioned, outlining their functionality and any necessary input fields.

---

Please ensure that the design takes into account user experience principles, making it intuitive and easy to navigate. Highlight any potential user interactions and provide a logical flow for the deployment process.

---

Examples of similar interfaces include:  
- A deployment dashboard used in cloud management platforms.  
- Policy management screens from enterprise security software.

---

Be cautious to avoid overly complex language or technical jargon that might confuse users. Ensure that the design adheres to best practices in user interface design, focusing on clarity and ease of use.
